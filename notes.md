pdf parser

pypdf allows for page range extraction. should i extract entire section 2 range? or just individual questions
ext 2 topics is 26 to 42
ext 1 topics is 46 to 61
ok, have topics as a pdf.
embed topics with langchain?

ok for each paper
title of post for each q is paper name
parse question number
parse tags

essentially

find where section 2 starts
assume all start wiht q 11
from each page get question number
use chatgpt to get tags
make post with title, tags, and question

mr lin's methods of studying

going through past papers is very inefficient

- horizontal stack
"stages" of difficulty of questions - in this case by question number

go through each stage 

- actually try to solve the question
- after 15 mins actually no idea, ask someone on server or look at solution

leave stage when you have clear idea of how to do each q (not necessarily full solution)

you will mostly likely have an idea of which topics you are weak in

deep stacking

- go through each topic and do all the questions you can
